A tool for figuring out when you might go broke. It doesn't actually work.

https://startuprunway.io is pretty good, even though it's not geared for personal use.

## Documentation

This app is implemented using a typical react-redux pattern, and most of the useful documentation lives in the codebase as JSDoc.

* To learn more about application state, read `src/reducers/index.js`.
